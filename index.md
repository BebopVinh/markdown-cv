## Summary

I am a Software Engineer with skills in Ruby on Rails, React, PostgreSQL and prior experience in hospitals and laboratories as an Electrical Designer. I have coordinated with multiple teams outside of my disciplines to integrate different designs seamlessly. I also learned to work within set boundaries due to limited resources given while delivering code-compliant and cost effective plans. I am looking forward to putting these skills and my coding capabilities towards building amazing applications.
